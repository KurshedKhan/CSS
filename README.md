# CSS
CSS Stands for Cascading Style sheet <br> <br>
In Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), cascading refers to the algorithm that determines how user agents combine property values from various sources. The cascade is a fundamental aspect of CSS, and it's responsible for resolving conflicts that occur when multiple CSS rules are applied to the same HTML element. 
Here are some key points about cascading in CSS: 
Priority
The style sheet with the highest priority controls how content is displayed. 
Inheritance
When an HTML element contains another element, the parent element often passes down traits to its child. For example, if you change the font of the parent element, the child element will also inherit the new font. 
Conflicting styles
When multiple conflicting styles are applied to the same element, some will override others based on a set of priority rules. For example, an inline style will typically override an external or internal style. 
User control
CSS allows users to have more control over presentation. For example, a user can apply a different style sheet if they find red italic headings difficult to read.
